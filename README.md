*Ken Tannenbaum – Senior Staff Quality Assurance Engineer • Systems & Protocol Designer • AI Exploration*

Professionally, I serve as a Senior Staff Quality Assurance Engineer with a growing focus on structured engineering workflows and platform-scale quality thinking. I’m particularly interested in how systems, protocols, and clearly defined boundaries shape resilient software environments.

Beyond my core role, I build across OS-adjacent AI mediation systems, civic drafting frameworks, investigative tooling prototypes, and publication-grade publishing architecture. These efforts explore how thoughtful governance, constraint, and human-centered design can shape durable systems over time.

I am drawn to problems that demand structure, clarity, and long-horizon thinking — and I’m intentionally building toward work that operates at that scale.

**[Aegis](https://github.com/finnoybu/aegis)** represents a long-horizon design initiative exploring an OS-adjacent AI mediation layer — one that evaluates human intent, clarifies consequences, and enforces explicit boundaries before actions are executed.

The project remains an evolving investigation into governance, protocol design, and AI-augmented systems architecture. Supporting this effort, **[Aegis Labs](https://github.com/finnoybu/aegis-labs)** serves as the public-facing research and documentation space, capturing architectural principles and emerging design patterns as they develop.

At its foundation, Aegis explores whether meaningful human–machine boundary governance can be designed and enforced as a structural property of software systems. Rather than treating safety and mediation as reactive safeguards, the initiative investigates whether authority, constraint, and consequence-awareness can operate as first-class architectural requirements — ensuring systems remain accountable to clearly defined boundaries, even when explicitly permitted to act.

The initiative is grounded in a simple principle: *capability without constraint is not intelligence.*

**[Forensickle](https://github.com/finnoybu/forensickle)** is a developing investigative tooling initiative exploring how structured digital forensics workflows can begin locally and expand into broader analytical environments. The concept starts with accessible, script-driven data collection and offline review, designed for individual practitioners and small teams.

The longer-term vision is to extend this foundation into a web-based platform where collected artifacts can be uploaded, correlated, and analyzed across systems — providing deeper context and structured comparison while remaining open, transparent, and accessible.

**[AmericansForPropriety](https://github.com/finnoybu/americansforpropriety)** is a civic drafting and institutional clarity initiative focused on articulating jurisdictional boundaries, governance norms, and structural accountability in accessible language. The project provides policy context and structured drafting tools designed to support disciplined and informed civic participation.

At its core, the initiative examines how governance frameworks can be expressed as coherent systems — making institutional roles, authority boundaries, and procedural responsibility more visible and understandable to the public.

## <img src="./svg/book.svg" width="16" height="16" /> Narrative & Web Systems

Beyond governance and investigative tooling, I build structured publishing and web architecture projects that apply systems discipline to content and user experience. This includes **[The Wellings](https://github.com/finnoybu/the-wellings)**, a publication-grade children’s book series with defined canon and production governance, as well as long-form archival initiatives such as **[Memoirs](https://github.com/finnoybu/memoirs)** — a digital preservation project documenting my great-grandfather’s experiences as a Norwegian Merchant Marine in the late 19th century.

These projects serve as execution laboratories — exploring how narrative platforms, content workflows, and static web infrastructure can be designed with clarity, consistency, and long-horizon maintainability.
