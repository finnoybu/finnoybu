- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on setting up my github repositories, my github page (powered by [mdwiki](mdwiki.info) which, sadly, isn't being maintained, and converting my ancestor's memoirs to markdown so I can publish them on the web.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python, markdown, a bit of javascript and... only if I have to... jquery.  But that's a story for another day.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with pretty much everything.  I'm a late bloomer when it comes to coding, but have an insatiable thirst for learning.  I'm always looking for feedback, constructive criticism and any tips on how to improve my work.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [finnoybu@gmail.com](mailto:finnoyb@gmail.com?subject=A note from a GitHub user)

- ðŸ‘´ Pronouns: he/him/his

- âš¡ Fun fact: 'Finnoybu' is the nickname given to my great-great grandfather during his time in the Norwegian merchant marine.  I adopted the name when his memoirs were passed to me circa 1999, after I was reunited with my birth mother and family, more than 30 years after I had myself been adopted.
