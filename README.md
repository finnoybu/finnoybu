- 🔭 I’m currently working on setting up my github repositories, my github page (powered by [mdwiki](mdwiki.info) which, sadly, isn't being maintained, and converting my ancestor's memoirs to markdown so I can publish them on the web.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, markdown, a bit of javascript and... only if I have to... jquery.  But that's a story for another day.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with pretty much everything.  I'm a late bloomer when it comes to coding, but have an insatiable thirst for learning.  I'm always looking for feedback, constructive criticism and any tips on how to improve my work.
